 <p>I’ve lost count of the number of times I have seen New York destroyed in the cinema. There’s something about the 
  city’s iconic status that seems to invite film-makers to trash it.But just when you think you have seen every conceivable 
  version of skyscraper-toppling movie mayhem, a gigantic creature that looks like a mutated rhinoceros thunders through 
  Central Park zoo in search of love. The joy of this spin-off from the Harry Potter-verse is that by viewing it through a
  Hogwarts-tinted lens we rediscover he magical allure of Manhattan at its most grubby and gothic. It’s no accident that two 
  of the antagonists in the picture are the people who are endeavouring to clean the city up.
